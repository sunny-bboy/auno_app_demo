## About

Auno is a business assistant app that brings together the tools you need to start and run a business from your phone. We built it specifically for South African entrepreneurs who want to formalize their businesses without the usual complexity.

The app combines AI-powered chat, secure messaging, simplified business registration, and a drag-and-drop website builder. Everything works offline-first, so you're not dependent on constant connectivity.

### Core Features

- Conversational AI assistant for business guidance and support
- Encrypted real-time messaging for customer communication
- Streamlined CIPC business registration process
- Website builder that requires zero coding knowledge
- Secure authentication and data protection

### Technology

Built with Flutter and Dart for consistent performance across Android and iOS devices. The architecture prioritizes speed and reliability, especially on entry-level smartphones common in our target market.
